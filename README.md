#  Credit Card Expense Analysis Dashboard

##  Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to **analyze customer and transaction-level credit card data** to generate actionable insights using **Power BI Dashboards**. These insights help stakeholders understand customer behavior, revenue patterns, and cost breakdowns to improve business strategies.

### 1.  Customer Dashboard

Focuses on customer demographics and revenue contribution.

**Key Visuals:**

* Revenue by gender, state, and marital status
* Job role vs revenue
* Education level distribution
* Salary group, number of dependents, and age group analysis
* Revenue trend over time

### 2.  Transaction Dashboard

Provides insights into transaction metrics and card usage trends.

**Key Visuals:**

* Revenue by card category (Silver, Gold, etc.)
* Expenditure by job role and type
* Interest earned, annual fees breakdown
* Payment method usage (chip, swipe, online)
* Customer acquisition cost by card tier
* Quarterly trends in transaction volume and revenue
